# What is machine learning?
- Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
  - Arthur Samuel (1959)
- Well-posed learning problem: A computer program is said to _learn_ from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
  - Tom Mitchell (1998)
- 2 main types of learning algorithms
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning

# Supervised learning
- Input data is already labelled. We already know how what results should look like. We can give answers to the learning algorithm.
- Categorized into 2 types of problems:
  - Regression
    - Goal is to predict results within a continuous output
      - map input variables to a continuous function
  - Classification
    - Goal is to predict results in a discrete output
      - map input variables to discrete categories

# Unsupervised learning
- Input data is unlabelled. We do now know how results should look ahead of time. The learning algorithm needs to figure out the answer on its own.
- Structure is often derived by using clustering
- Clustering
  - Given a collection of data, automatically group the data points by identifying similar traits using different variables
- Non-clustering
  - Given data, find structure from it
